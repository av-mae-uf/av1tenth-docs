Honesty Policy
---------------

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, "We, the members of the
University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest
standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for
credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or
implied: "On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this
assignment."

Honesty Penalty
---------------

All work is to be done individually or in groups where indicated. Any copied submission will result in a zero for that
assignment and a letter grade reduction for the course. For example, if your final grade was
to be a B+, it would be reduced to a C+. It will be considered an act of academic dishonesty (on both
parties) if a student shares the  solution with a student who did not exhibit an
effort to complete the activity.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
---------------------------------------------

Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with the Disability Resource Center
(352-392-8565, https://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc) by providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students
will receive an accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodation.
Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in the semester.

Course Evaluation
-----------------

Students are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing online
evaluations at https://evaluations.ufl.edu/evals. Evaluations are typically open during the last two or three
weeks of the semester, but students will be given specific times when they are open. Summary results of
these assessments are available to students at https://evaluations.ufl.edu/results/.

Commitment to a Safe and Inclusive Learning Environment
-------------------------------------------------------

The Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering values broad diversity within our community and is
committed to individual and group empowerment, inclusion, and the elimination of discrimination. It is
expected that every person in this class will treat one another with dignity and respect regardless of gender,
