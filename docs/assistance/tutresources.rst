Tutorial Resources
===================

This page will serve as an area to access different tutorials and resources required to be successful in this class. If you find something that may help your class mates, let us know and we will
add it in here

Python
^^^^^^

It is expected to have a basic understanding of Python and general programming before beginning this class. Two python resources we recommend are given below :

* `Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_
* `W3Schools Python <https://www.w3schools.com/python/>`_ (I would go through the basic tutorials and NumPy)

.. note::  These are not the be-all and end-all tutorial resources for python. Looking up Python Tutorials will avail thousands's of good resources. You just need to pick what's best for you.

Bash
^^^^

You need to know a couple of bash commands to run ROS2 or even python for that matter. We will have a cheat sheet of commonly used bash commands for ROS2 and in general. 
Though, it is good to remember that Bash can do a lot more that what we will cover in the class

* `Ubuntu Linux Command Line Tutorial <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview>`_
* `Linux Tutorial <https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php>`_
* `Linux Command Line Cheat Sheet <https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/>`_ (This is just a cheat sheet, but is useful tool for learning as well)

ROS 2
^^^^^

We do not expect you to start learning ROS2 before coming to the class, we will teach all the necessary tools and will go through tutorials explaining what each snippets of code does, but we will
leave this here for convinience, and curiousity.

* `ROS 2 Tutorial <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html>`_

.. tip:: We have a comprehensive `cheat sheet <../assistance/cheatsheet.html>`_ for all the commands you will require in ROS2 and Bash, though a lot of the python will be left to you to figure out.
