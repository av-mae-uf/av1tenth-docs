Cost
^^^^^

The total cost of this system is $786.01 to start building one car, though many parts will not need to be bought again if building more as they are sold in bulk. Those parts are as follows:

* WiFi USB Module (Only need one to two to connect to theinternet, most operation will be offline)
* Fastners (Sold in packs of 100)
* Connectors (Bulk or Kits)
* LiPO Chargers (Will need at least half of intended batteries to be used)

10 Cars Are planned to be build, total cost (without bulk pricing and shipping) will be approximateley $6800. There are other extra costs associated with building a course, wiring etc. that have not been covered here.
