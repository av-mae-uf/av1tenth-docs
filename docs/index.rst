Welcome to EML 4832: Autonomous Vehicles class documentation. This site will serve as a main page for the class. 
All information to be successful in the class will be posted up here, including all assignments, milestones, and projects.

If you are a student in the class, start at the top with `tutorial resources <assistance/tutresources.html>`_ so that you are prepared for the class.
Don't be discouraged if you are confused, we will assist you through completing this class. ROS 2 is confusing. It takes sometime to fully 
understand what it is doing.

.. .. tip:: If you want to build the car yourself for personal or other educational use, look at the vehicle information section. The `parts <vehicle_information/parts.html>`_ section outlines every piece of hardware required.
