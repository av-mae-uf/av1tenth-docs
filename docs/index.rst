Welcome to EML4930: Autonomous Vehicles documentation. This site will serve as a main page for the class. All information to be successful in the class will be posted up here, including all assignments, milestones and projects. Explore the sections below to learn more about the
hardware and software. 

If you are a student in the class, start at the top with `tutorial resources <tutresources.html>`_ so that you are prepared for the class.
Don't be discouraged if you are confused, we will assist you through completing this class. 

.. seealso:: ROS2 is confusing. It takes sometime to fully understand what it is doing. `ROS2 website <https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html>`_ does a decent job of explaining what is going on.

If you want to build the car yourself for personal or other educational use, look at the extra information section. The `parts <parts.html>`_ section outline every piece of hardware required.
