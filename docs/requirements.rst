Requirements
============

There are several requirements, both hardware and software that are required to build and run the car. They have been all outlined here.

Minimum Hardware Required for Software 
--------------------------------------

.. note::  Our software does not need to be run on single board computers, the simulation package can be run on any computer with the minimum requirements supported

You will need some sort of computer that can run Ubuntu 20.04 (preferred), or a Debian equivalent of the Focal release (If installing through Debian packages, Debian Buster 10 will also work if built from source). A minimum requirement sheet is given below.

* 2 GHz dual-core processor
* 4 GiB RAM
* 50 GB disk space
* Display compatible (HDMI/VGA/DVI etc.)
* USB Port(s)
* Internet Access
  
These are the minimum requirements for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa. If you're looking for used computer check out the `UF Surplus website <https://surplus.ufl.edu/buy-now/>`_. These can be run on VM's but some software will have issues with our simulation package Gazebo, we recommend having a dual-boot or dedicated computer that can run Ubuntu 20.04.

.. warning:: Our package later on will require topic sharing over a network. We haven't been able to get it running on VM's as of yet, so native linux computers are highly recommended.

Software Requirements
---------------------

There are several software requirements to run our automation package, or be succesful in this class. They are all outlined below.

Software Used
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_ (Or Equivalent Debian release)
* `ROS2 Foxy <https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html>`_
* `Python3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
* `Gazebo <https://gazebosim.org/home>`_

There are several optional software packages that we like to use during development in our lab.

* `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_
* `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ (A useful tool for collaboration and to get code onto the vehicle)
* `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/>`_ (An alternative to GitHub)

.. note::  If you need help installing anything talk to the TA's for this class. There is also a bootable drive with Ubuntu 20.04 available in the CIMAR Lab

Programming Requirements
------------------------

This class is a programming heavy class. Almost all work being done requires programming knowledge. You will need the following to be successful in this class.

* Python3 Programming
* NumPy
* Bash Commands (You do not need to know all of them, just the basics)

There are tutorial links and resources available in the `Tutorial Resources <tutresources.html>`_ page.
