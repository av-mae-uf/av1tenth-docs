Charging the Battery
=======================

To charge the battery for the cars, you must use a LiPo capable battery charger. Generally there are three types of ways to charge
the LiPo batteries, charging, quick charge, and battery balance. The mode that is best for the health of the batteries is 
the balance mode. This allows for each of the cells in the battery to be charged concurrently and balanced to ensure
that each cell is outputting approximateley the same voltage. The procedure to charge the battery is as follows

* Plug in the charger to a wall outlet.
* Plug in the battery by both its cables to the charger.
* Select Battery balance mode (shown in picture below).
